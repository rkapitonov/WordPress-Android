We’re pleased to announce several new WordPress mobile app features: 
- full-screen slideshows of photos or videos for WP.com and Jetpack sites; 
- the option to pick a homepage design when creating a WP.com site; 
- improved functionality for setting the dimensions of Cover and Columns;  
- and a Follow/Unfollow button for a site’s comments section, allowing users to track a conversation and be notified by email of updates (not supported for self-hosted sites that aren’t connected to Jetpack).
